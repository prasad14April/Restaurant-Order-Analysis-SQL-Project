üçΩÔ∏è Project Name-Restaurant Order Analysis-SQL

üéØ Objective:To analyze restaurant order data and understand customer preferences, sales trends, and popular menu items using SQL. The goal is to practice SQL operations such as table creation, joins, grouping, and aggregation on a small relational dataset.

üí° Problem Statement: A restaurant wants to analyze its order data to make better business decisions. 
They want to know:
-Find Total Orders
-Show all Customers
- How much total revenue is earned
-What is average order value
- Find all customers from Mumbai
- List all items ordered in order ID = 101
-Which menu items are most popular
- Which customers are the most valuable
- How different cities are contributing to orders
-Sorting of customers alphabetically
-Category wise Revenue

Using SQL, we‚Äôll create the database, load the data, and answer these business questions.

TECHNOLOGIES USED- MY SQL WORKBENCH,MY SQL is the RDBMS

Try these quick tests:
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM menu_items;
SELECT * FROM orders;
SELECT * FROM order_details;

üîó Relationships / E-R Diagram
‚Ä¢ CUSTOMERS(1) ‚Üí ORDERS(Many) = One-to-Many (A customer can place many orders)
‚Ä¢ ORDERS(1) ‚Üí ORDER_DETAILS(Many) = One-to-Many (An order can contain many items)
‚Ä¢ MENU_ITEMS(1) ‚Üí ORDER_DETAILS(Many) = One-to-Many (A menu item can appear in many orders)
Relationships: - customers (1) ‚Üí (many) orders - orders (1) ‚Üí (many) order_details - menu_items (1) ‚Üí (many) order_details
Basic E-R Structure:
CUSTOMERS (customer_id) | | 1 --- many | ORDERS (order_id, customer_id) | | 1 --- many | ORDER_DETAILS (order_id, item_id) | | many --- 1
| MENU_ITEMS (item_id)
